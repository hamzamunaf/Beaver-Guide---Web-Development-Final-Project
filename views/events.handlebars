      <div class="post-description">This exhibit features about 100 black-and-white and color photographs that interpret the closing lines of one of the most enduring poems by one of America's most beloved poets—“The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost. The 26 photographers participating in the exhibit were asked to take a look “off the beaten path” in response to the poem's final stanza:</div>

      <div class="post-description">The ONE HEALTH paradigm is the concept that human, environmental and animal health are closely interconnected. It also recognizes that many different disciplines contribute together to the ONE HEALTH goal. As a veterinarian engaged in production animals medicine, and then later also in small animal medicine in Switzerland, this paradigm has been my guiding North Star throughout my years as a veterinarian but also during my science career. At the core of ONE HEALTH are zoonotic diseases, which are diseases that are spread between animals and humans. This includes vector-borne diseases transmitted by, for example, ticks, fleas or mosquitoes, to viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections passed on from more or less direct human-animal contact. Aquatic animals are no exclusion to those transmissions, even though we might have a less tight bond with those animals. While my research focuses on disease processes in aquatic animals, I aim to also include the third leg of the paradigm (Environmental Health) by creating environmentally sustainable treatment solutions, using natural elements of the environment such as marine beneficial bacteria (probiotics) or herbal supplements to fight disease agents or to positively influence the host immune system.</div>

        <div class="post-description">What is the Oregon Employees' Charitable Fund Drive? The CFD is a campaign that consolidates charitable solicitation into a once-a-year campaign. It offers access to a wide range of charities -- over 700 of them -- and gives state and university employees control over where their donations go. The first Charitable Fund Drive was implemented by Executive Order in 1989.
          When you contribute to the Charitable Fund Drive, 100% of your donation goes to the organizations you designate. Last year's fund drive administrative costs (paid by the funds and federations - no donor or state funds used) were less than ten percent of the overall funds raised.
          When you make a payroll pledge in 2019, your donation dollars will be deducted starting with the first paycheck of 2020.
